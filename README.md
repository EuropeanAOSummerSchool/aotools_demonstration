# AOtools Demonstration

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for the worked examples of using AOtools to model and analyse adaptive optics systems and data for the European AO Summer School.

In order to run these notebooks you will need to have a working Python installation with the [aotools](https://github.com/AOtools/aotools) package installed. For people new to programming in Python we recommend using the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator) of Python and installing aotools using the following command from a command line: `conda install -c aotools aotools`
